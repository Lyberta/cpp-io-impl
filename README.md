# What-used-to-be the implementation of P2146 - Modern std::byte stream IO for C++

Hi. You've probably reached this repo because you're looking for the implementation of [P2146](https://wg21.link/p2146).

Well, unfortunately, I had to pivot my life away from C++ and deleted everything. But one day it may return. Perhaps one day...

I may still provide the implementation if you ask via e-mail but please don't use Gmail or other mainstream e-mail providers. They complain about lack of DKIM and reject my e-mails as spam. And I'm way too busy with other stuff to setup proper DKIM on my own server right now.

Oh, and don't expect any support. Last time I opened a C++ IDE was in 2021, I was shocked, wanted to vomit and closed the IDE after that. I'm taking a very long break from IT in general.
